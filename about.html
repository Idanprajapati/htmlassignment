                        honour with the FA Cup in 1904. It had its first major period of success in the
                        late 1960s, winning the League, FA Cup and League Cup under the management of
                        Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison. After losing the 1981 FA Cup Final, the club
                        went through a period of decline, which eventually saw them relegated as far
                        down as third tier of English football by the end of the 1997–98 season.
                        They since regained promotion to the top tier in 2001–02 and have remained a
                        fixture in the Premier League since 2002–03. In 2008, Manchester City was
                        purchased by Abu Dhabi United Group for £210 million and received considerable
                        financial investment.
                        The club have won six domestic league titles. Under the management of Pep Guardiola
                        they won the Premier League in 2018 becoming the only Premier League team to attain
                        100 points in a single season. In 2019, they won four trophies, completing an
                        unprecedented sweep of all domestic trophies in England and becoming the first
                        English men's team to win the domestic treble. Manchester City's revenue was
                        the fifth highest of a football club in the world in the 2017–18 season at €527.7
                        million.In 2018, Forbes estimated the club was the fifth most valuable in
                        the world at $2.47 billion.</td>
